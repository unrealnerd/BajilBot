# Chatty
This Application is still a noob in github, started recently as a pet project. Will be updating the Readme file soon with usage of this application once it is in shape.

Intention of this application once done will be to support as an interactive chat bot for different services. Right now all this application does is uses **Twilio whatsapp sandbox** and **Corporate Bull Shit Buzzword API** for messages sent in this format

`cbs\<anything>`

This will use generate a radom BS Buzzword using [Corporate Bull Shit Buzzword API](https://github.com/sameerkumar18/corporate-bs-generator-api) as a reply on Whatsapp.
